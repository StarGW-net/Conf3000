Limbo:
You are surrounded by a swirling mist. Ghosts appear then fade away into the
mist. Strange sounds from other dimensions echo far out across the timeless
mist. Infact your average Top of the Pops set.

The We all hate HCI & Graphics Channel:
Everything on this channel is written down on a over head projector and 
quickly removed before you can copy it down.  It's no use complaining 'cos the
notes are all in the staff-section of the library. Oh yes and you have to
buy all these expensive books and do three times as much course work as other
lectures.
This channel is usually empty because no-one bothers turning up.

And there's fook all on it (as usual), oh `sept them films that Prophet always
watches with the sub-titles.

You are in a dark alley way somewhere in France.
Further down this alley way you can see three men dressed in bright red coats
and wearing large black hats with poofy feathers in them.  They are all carrying
swords and are currently using them to run another shorter fellow through, who
is wearing the exact same uniforms as them.

An empty pub, low lighting, never a queue at the bar.
A jukebox that plays and you can still hear people speaking,
an empty pool table and lots of seating.
@

You enter a lonely bar and see a sad fat Lancastrian, guzzeling beer
in the corner.
@
15
There's a bar like it in every town. It's dimly-lit and the drinkers, although
they talk, don't address their words to one another and they don't listen,
either. They just talk the hurt inside. It's a bar for the derelict and the
unlucky and all those people who have been temporarily flagged off the 
racetrack of life into the pits.
  It always does a brisk trade.

Making your way in the world today,
Takes everything you've got.
Taking a break from all you're worries,
Sure would help alot.
Wouldn't you like to get away
To someplace where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came.
You wanna be where you can see,
People are all same,
You wanna be where everybody knows you're name.
@

Pushing through the door, you find yourself engulfed by smoke.  Through the
haze you glimpse a bar heading off into the far distant horizion.  The gleam
of taps draws you forth and in desperation you order 12 pints.  As you settle
back in your stool, pint in hand, the room darkens and your attention is
drawn to the stage.  The curtains draw back and three scantilly dressed men
appear.  The music starts, the men turn towards you and with excitement you
recognise their faces......

The corner shop!
A place where you go to buy cherry drops.
And remember to smile so you to can have happy conversation with the femmes.
Or go later when the guy is in there if you are that way declined.

N.B. if you buy a pie or sausage roll and they do not ask you if you would like
it heated up you are in the wrong place.

Point Zenith.
=============

You are at the top of a dark tower in a circular room roofed with pink
crystal. There are various spiral stairways winding down into the lower
levels, and a large black column stands in the centre. The column hums
slightly and flashes red and green LEDs periodically.

offerings the legends 'Atari' and 'Commodore' are just visible amongst the 
scattered remains.

Dealing with post-conf blues, also know as Real Life Shock:

  Try to avoid dealing with the Real World whenever possible.  I mean,
  be _in_ it and performing whatever minor function you have to, but
  unless your doing something good (like computing, drinking, eating etc.)
  just pretend it's not there.

(Dreddy) You mean this isn't the Real World !!

The Prophet's Room:
This small room is dark and dimly lit by a fading candle flickering in the
draught. Strewn on the floor are empty discarded bottles of meths. From a dark
corner huge speakers can be heard playing blues ballads with massive bass:

    'It used to be so easy to give my heart away
     But I found out the hard way there's a price to pay
     I found out that love is no friend of mine'

@
51
Prophet's Kitchen:
There's a mushroom pizza cooking gently in the oven. Two flickering candles
romantically light the room. On the table wine glasses of Old Peculiar
sparkle as they catch the light. From the next room you can here music with
massive bass playing:
   
    'I ride all alone and can't see
     The road to nowhere anymore
     And shadows whispers are calling me
     To forbidden forests by the shore'

  There is a flat glowing circle in the centre of a room. Under this circle is
a man with a bottle of Vodka in one hand and a keyboard in his lap. The bottle
looks seriously empty. The keyboard is attached to a machine, which is playing
a cross between Lemmings and SimCity. The screen shows a device that looks
like a nuclear warhead. The warhead falls quickly towards an island similar to
Britain, it falls towards a city identical to Hull, centering on a building
remarkably like this one.
Arkangel grins loudly.

There is an empty bottle of Timotei shampoo and some freebee sashes of Vim.
@

This is Black Riders front room, its a bit of a mess at the moment but I'm 
sure you'll excuse that. It is full of empty wine bottles and cigarette stubs.
A cat is running about fo*k$"g anoying everybody and on occasions yanking
the modem out the wall. There is an old dusty BBC winking at you from the 
corner and a small black and white TV. A tape recorder sits next to it with a
german version a planetiod.
@

This is Black Riders bedroom, welcome one and all 8-) its a bit smelly and 
mouldy socks lie stuck to the floor in heaps. There is some movement from a
pile of clothes in the corner and the place is littered with torn pieces of

This is Black Riders thinking room. Not that the room thinks of course that
is just a silly play on words because my grammer is so appauling. No, its a
room to go and think, it has a nice view out a large window of a forest where
if you look really hard you can sometimes see small mice running.

	You find yourself in a rather nice room, which is tastefully decorated
and the main word which springs to mind is SCHNEAKY! Funnily enough, you are
actually in the room belonging to Schneaky, and so it's not really suprising.
In one corner there is a 286 PC, and flashing on the SVGA screen is the message
'Schneaky's room'. There is also a canned drinks machine and a crisps and 
sweets machine next to that. They are free to all Schneaky's guests, but that's just the kind of guy he is. There are a couple of leather sofas in the middle 
of the room, so feel free to sit down or help yourself to something to eat 
or drink.
@
76
Suddenly, you find yourself in a cosy little room, which could only belong 
to one person - Schneaky. This room is only open by invitation, and so you
are very priviledged to be in here. Anyway, make yourself at home and feel
free to make yourself a cup of tea or coffee.

You have now entered Snoopy's kennel beware of fleas and half eaten bones

lives in the chemistry labs. Enjoy your stay and please leave a bone on 
the pile in the corner as rent.

Rockets Launch Pad:
As you enter you notice an unbeleivable warm atmosphere...people are walking
around in asbestos underwear to protect their faculties. You notice in the
corner the remnants of spacesuit charred and scorched by the intense heat of a

and wear it with pride as Rocket is off on a bike ride to the moon ....

	People do not come here often ;infact people who do come here
do not come here of there own accord.
They do not stay,or,live long here either.

a thing.

Your inside Sinjy's ice palace.
This is clearly the most chilled-out place on the whole of the Net.
The lighting is very dim almost non-existant, while colours of purple and
red and yellow dance merrily about you vision from no apparent source.
Ambient House Music is piped quietly into the background filling your senses 
with the sounds of nature.  With free ice-cream, cola ice-lollies and
coke for all.

This is a very large and cold ice palace.  A blue and yellow flag flies
high above with the werds "Sinjy the Sinj" stitched on in a fake Japanese
gold substitue.

Welcome to channel 90 you have now entered the local park.
There is a minature train running round the perimiter for you to have a 
ride on. Over in the distance you can see a playground with swings and 
roundabouts, a slide and a climbing frame all waiting to be played on
by someone.
The whole area is green and grassy full of trees to climb and lots of
open area to play in. To the right is a small lake with ducks on it 
just waiting to be fed by the visitors to this park in a hidden corner 
of Conf 3000.

This channel is really most excellent.
It looks like a most triumphant University.  Two large statue-like
d00des are the centre piece here.  On the base of the statue is the
saying "Be Excellent to each other".

*The* Year channel.
This is when we (the *real* *Netfolk*) sod of to /usr/games/real_life
and play about getting jobs.  If it's passed this year then you probs
don't know us (You lucky lucky people) and it also means that the new
owner of conf is too lazy to change the channel descriptions.

You are in a large stone walled room, with an impressivly large Inglenook
Fireplace set into one wall.  There is a desk here which is completely
filled with nothing at all, but the floor is covered with sheets of A4
with random scribblings on.  A bent Zippo, three packets of Rizzla's
and a box with a funny looking leaf embossed on it lie on the victorian
Four Poster bed.  A misty haze of smoke drifts accross the room......

You feel very relaxed here.....
