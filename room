The Accrington Stanley FC changing room.

There is a strong stale smell of socks, and sweaty clothes, 
NOT a nice place to be in!

In the corner there is a refreshments cabinet with the following contents:
   A pint of milk for Phoenix,
   A pint of cider for Icarus,
   A pint of <whatever> for Sinjy,
   and small helpings of orange juce for everyone else.
