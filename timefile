10 Prophet gets out his guitar and plugs it into the amp
10 #There's a girl who believes#
10 #All that glitters is gold,#
10 #And she's buying a Stairway to Heaven.#
10 #When she gets there she knows#
10 #If the stores are all closed,#
10 #With a word she can get what she came for.#
10 #Oh oh ohh oh#
10 #Oh oh ohhhh oh oh ohhh oh#   (feel free to join in)
10 #And she's buying a Stairway To Heaven.#
